* Visual Studio 2019(for Windows)

Other versions of Visual Studio may also work, but version of Visual Studio used to compile BrainFlow should match version of Visual Studio in Unreal Engine.

### Installation

* Compile BrainFlow for your OS, arch, and build type 
* Create Plugins folder in your project(skip it if you already have one)
* Copy [this folder](https://github.com/brainflow-dev/BrainFlowUnrealPlugin/tree/master/BrainFlowPlugin) to your Plugins folder
* Refresh your VS solution, in Unreal Engine Player click *File->Refresh Visual Studio Project*
* Enable BrainFlowPlugin for your project. In *[ProjectName].Build.cs* add smth like `PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore", "BrainFlowPlugin" });`
